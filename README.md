# TaskTrackerCli
This is a simple task tracker cli I made after seeing the idea on https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker
The commands are the same as the ones on the website with the difference being that you need to replace the task-cli in the command with:
```
python task-cli.py
```
This is because I am not really too sure how to fix this.
